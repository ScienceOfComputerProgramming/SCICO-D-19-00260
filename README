PomCho: a tool chain for choreographic design

PomCho is a tool chain for model-driven development of message-passage applications.
The key features of the tool chain allow designers to identify misbehaviour leading to unsound communications,
to provide counterexamples, and to suggest possible corrections as well as to project global specifications
to local models in order to generate executable implementations.

To install the dependencies required by PomCho on Ubuntu 18.04 execute
```
#!bash
./setup.sh
```

To start PomCho execute
```
#!bash
cd cc
./gui.py
```

The examples are in aux/experiments/jlamp2020
